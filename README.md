# "Web technologies" course project

This is "Web technologies" course project made using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js and RemoteMySQL/phpMyAdmin database.
We were supposed to make web application. You can find demo video showing how my application works. Design for web application is responsive. It contains validations for all input fields. Demo video shows how to make new exercise. If user tries to choose non-pdf file, error message appears. Also, if you try to make already existing exercise you get error message. Last part of video shows pdf file for exercise we just created.
